## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab

## Analysis Workflow

1. Dataset loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Churn distribution
   - Contract type vs churn
   - Monthly charges vs churn
   - Customer tenure vs churn  
4. Insight generation and business recommendations  

---

## Key Insights

- Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit significantly higher churn.
- Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn risk.
- Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.

---

## Business Recommendations

- Encourage customers to opt for long-term contracts through targeted incentives.
- Provide personalized offers or discounts to high-paying customers.
- Improve onboarding and early engagement to reduce early-stage churn.
